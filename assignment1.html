				<p> Our science-first approach creates music that sounds
				different - and affects your brain differently-than any other music.</p>

				<h2> Patented Technology </h2>
				<p>
					Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating
					functional music, including technology to elicit<b> strong neural phase locking</b>
					-allowing populations of neurons to engage in 
					various kinds of coordinated activity-and technology to remove distraction in sound.
				</p>
				<p>
					This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other words, we've found new ways to
				</p>
				<p>create music that helps you so what you need to do.</p>

				<h2>Tested On Brain and Behavior</h2>
				<p>
				  Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiments.
				</p>
				<p>
					We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Our experiments always include a control condition (‘placebo’)</b> of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference.
